# Sendy.Net
=========
Sendy.Net is a .Net library that can be used to interact with the Sendy API. Subscribe, Unsubscribe, access subscriber status, lists, create and list campaigns.

It has been built to interact version 1.1.6

## When to use it?
If you have recently decided to use [Sendy](http://sendy.co/) over an existing email campaign/newsletter service, then you can simply call the Sendy.Net API from within your code.

It is especially useful if you are creating your own user/client database, so are saving details prior to subscribing them to the email campaign/newsletter service.

## What is Sendy
<center><img src="http://sendy.co/images/sendy-logo.jpg" /></center>
> [Sendy](http://sendy.co/) is a self hosted email newsletter application that lets you send trackable emails via [Amazon Simple Email Service SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/). This makes it possible for you to send authenticated bulk emails at an insanely low price without sacrificing deliverability.

## The Sendy API
> [Sendy's API](http://sendy.co/api) is based on simple HTTP POST. Use the API to integrate Sendy programmatically with your website or application. We're working to include more APIs.
